# Coach Dashboard for Patient Stats

[Pitch & Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/6b68e8a528ff4c818d51b296df5fa82e?sid=16053e75-39c2-4052-9554-04d1950777cf)

## The Problem
Tackling #3 & #4 from Euc's roadmap, this idea was born from a conversation with a Euc employee that brought to light the 16-hour window for a patient to receive the support they requested. While understandable, support is needed when support is needed. Thus, our solution was born.

## Our Solution
Leveraging Bland.ai's API and a Python web app, we created a workflow to accommodate for coaches' limited time, while bridging the communication gap between coaches and patients. Through the idea of daily check-ins initiated by our custom Bland.ai Conversational Pathways, we aim to connect with patients and record their progress, feelings, and anything that might help coaches know exactly what's going on with their patients. The data collected by Bland.ai is parsed by an LLM and displayed on a dashboard so that coaches can schedule calls whenever possible, while still providing on-time support to patients.

## Future Improvements
While a voice call allows for a connection that texting cannot mimic, a visual aspect is still missing from this medium. This is where our inspiration, Soul Machines, comes in. Soul machines allows holding a video call with an AI, along with the possibility to build your own. This could add another layer of personalisation when interacting with patients, even making it seem like they have one physical and one virtual coach.
